  <h1>First, all the rules</h1>
  <p>author: Don Clifton</p>

  <p>--Employees quit managers, not companies. If you have a turnover problem,
    look first to your managers. To be a great company, set clear expectations
    for manager behavior and hold them accountable for them.</p>
  <p>--Great managers build a solid foundation for employee success by ensuring
    employees can affirmatively answer the following, in order of priority:<br>
1) I know what is expected of me at work.<br>
2) I have the materials and equipment to do my job right.<br>
3) At work, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day.<br>
4) In the last 7 days, I have received recognition or praise for doing good
work.<br>
5) My supervisor seems to care about me as a person.<br>
6) There is someone at work who encourages my development.</p>
  <p>--The revolutionary insight shared by all great managers: people are true
    to their nature and don't change that much. Therefore, don't waste
    time/resources getting people to change or improve their weaknesses. Focus
    on maximizing their strengths instead.</p>
  <p>--Managers are catalysts: they link employees with company goals and
    customers. The four most important responsibilities of a great manager:<br>
1) select the right person<br>
2) set expectations<br>
3) motivate the person<br>
4) develop the person</p>
<p>--How to perform these 4 roles:<br>
1) select the right person based on talent (not just experience, intelligence,
or determination)<br>
2) set expectations by defining right outcomes, not the how<br>
3) when motivating someone, focus on strengths, not weaknesses<br>
4) when developing someone, help them find the right fit (not just the next rung
 on the ladder)<p>
<p>--The four keys:<br>
1. Select for talent<br>
2. Define the right outcomes<br>
3. Focus on strengths<br>
4. Find the right fit</p>
<p>--Selecting for talent is the manager's most important responsibility; without
   talent, all other efforts are useless. How to select for talent?<br>
1. Study your best people and hire more like them<br>
2. Know what talents you're looking for and relentlessly pursue them</p>
<p>--How to define the right outcomes?<br>
1. Provide the what, not the how. Don't get hung up on how - the most efficient
way to turn someone's talent into performance is to help her find her own path
of least resistance to the desired outcomes.<br>
2. Particular roles may require different standards/regulations (eg
contracting); find the balance between these standards while still placing the
premium on outcomes.</p>
<p>--Focus on each person's strengths and manage around their weaknesses. Don't
  try to perfect each person, but rather help them become more of who they
  already are.</p>
<p>--One of the signs of a great manager is the ability to describe, in detail,
  the unique talents of each of his people -- what drives each one, how each
  one thinks and how each one builds relationships.</p>
<p>--"The best managers are deliberate. They talk with each individual, asking
  about strengths, weaknesses, goals and dreams. They work closely with each
  employee, taking note of the choices each makes, the way they all interact,
  and who supports who and why. They notice things. They take their time because
   they know that the surest way to identify each person's talents is to watch
   their behavior over time. And then, yes, they separate the team into those
   who should stay and those who should be encouraged to find other roles. But,
   significantly, they add a third category: movers. These are individuals who
   have revealed some valuable talents but are not in a position to use them. By
    repositioning each in a redesigned role, great managers can focus on each
    person's strengths and turn talent into performance."</p>
<p>--Manage by exception - treat everyone as they would like to be treated,
  bearing in mind who they are. Everyone has different needs - some want praise
  in public vs private, some want to be left alone while others need attention.
   To develop this knowledge, ask and write it down! What is their taste in
   praise? Public or private, written or verbal - ask what most meaningful
   recognition they received was and what made it so memorable. Ask about how
   they learn and their preferred communication style,, what they want your
   relationship to be like. Do during onboarding and taking over new team.</p>
<p>--Spend the balance of your time with your best, not your strugglers. If you
  neglect your best they can turn into strugglers. Spending time with your best
   is the most efficient way to learn what differentiates good from bad -
   investigate success and attempt to pass it on, don't waste time investigating
    failure.</p>
<p>--Don't settle for average - it limits potential and creates an artificial
  ceiling. Define excellence vividly and quantitatively, paint a picture for
  your most talented employees of what excellence looks like - seek to push
  everyone to the right side of the bell curve.</p>
<p>--If an employee is displaying poor performance, look first to these two
  causes: 1) mechanical: company is not providing them with tools/information
  they need 2) personal eg trouble at home or death in family. Both are easy to
  use identify but difficult to solve. If not these, then determine:<br> 1) is
  improved performance trainable eg employee doesn't have required skills or
  knowledge<br> 2) is poor performance caused by the manager tripping the wrong
  trigger? Don't forget that everyone is motivated differently.</p>
<p>--Three options if someone has a weakness that can't be trained:<br> 1) devise
  a support system<br> 2) find a complementary partner<br> 3) find an
  alternative role</p>
