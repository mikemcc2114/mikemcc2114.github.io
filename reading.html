  <h1>The Data Detective by Tim Harford</h1>
  <p>date completed: 20211229</p>
  <p>--Beware your feelings and what they bias you to believe. We believe what
    we want to believe and are prone to selection bias of facts that support our
     view while ignoring points that don't. First, examine your feelings and
     what they make you inclined to believe; ask yourself "how does this make me
      feel?" </p>
  <p>--Weigh stories from two viewpoints - personal experience vs statistical
    summary. Be wary of Goodhart's law: "A statistical metric may be a pretty
    decent proxy for something that really matters, but it is almost always a
    proxy rather than the real thing. Once you start using that proxy as a
    target to be improved, or a metric to control others at a distance,
    it will be distorted, faked, or undermined. The value of the measure will
    evaporate."</p>
  <p>--Avoid premature enumeration - clarify what is being measured and how;
    what is the definition bring used? Start by asking what the claim actually
    means, in context! Eg rise in death rates really due to change in
    classification, not actual death rate change.</p>
  <p>--When presented with statistics, stop and think about context first.
    What do I feel about the numbers, why are they being presented, what is
    being presented, how was it counted, by what definition?</p>
  <p>--Step back and look for data to put the statistics in context. Don't think
    about it in isolation; what are the trends, what can it be compared to,
    what can give you a sense of scale.</p>
  <p>--Get the backstory: where was the data from and how was it collected? What
    was the sample size? How large was the effect? Was it statistically
    significant? Beware the replication crisis; don't rely on one study -
    what was a preponderance of the literature, covering multiple methods and
    results, suggest?</p>
  <p>--Ask who is missing, and how that may bias results. Was the study only
    conducted on WEIRD subjects (Western, Educated, and from Industrialized
    Rich Democracies)? Male vs female, young vs old? Was it a random,
    representative sample or was there sampling bias?</p>
  <p>--Don't confuse the right data with data that is easier to collect -
    introduces sample bias!</p>
  <p>--Beware using correlation for prediction. If you don't know what causes
    the correlation, you wont know what causes its' predictive power to
    breakdown. Eg google flu trends correlated flu with winter; it totally
    missed summer flu outbreak. Demand transparency in models IOT understand
    how they can break down and be exploited.</p>
  <p>--Computers and algorithms aren't racist, sexist, etc. But if they are
    trained on our own historical biases they can be. Ask which algorithms can
    we trust, and what can we trust them with?</p>
  <p>--Don't take statistical bedrock for granted. Statisticians can be
    pressured to change or omit the stats.</p>
  <p>--Never let zippy design distract you from the fact that the underlying
    numbers may be wrong.</p>
  <p>--Without well-defined standards for statistical record-keeping, nothing
    adds up. Numbers can easily confuse us when unmoored from a clear
    definition.</p>
  <p>--Bottom line: be curious and question everything!</p>
