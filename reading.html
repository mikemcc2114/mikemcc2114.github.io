  <h1>The Data Detective by Tim Harford</h1>
  <p>date completed: 2021-12-29</p>
  <p>--Beware your feelings and what they bias you to believe. We believe what
    we want to believe and are prone to selection bias of facts that support our
     view while ignoring points that don't. First, examine your feelings and
     what they make you inclined to believe; ask yourself "how does this make me
      feel?" </p>
  <p>--Weigh stories from two viewpoints - personal experience vs statistical
    summary. Be wary of Goodhart's law: "A statistical metric may be a pretty
    decent proxy for something that really matters, but it is almost always a
    proxy rather than the real thing. Once you start using that proxy as a
    target to be improved, or a metric to control others at a distance,
    it will be distorted, faked, or undermined. The value of the measure will
    evaporate."</p>
  <p>--Avoid premature enumeration - clarify what is being measured and how;
    what is the definition bring used? Start by asking what the claim actually
    means, in context! Eg rise in death rates really due to change in
    classification, not actual death rate change.</p>
  <p>--When presented with statistics, stop and think about context first.
    What do I feel about the numbers, why are they being presented, what is
    being presented, how was it counted, by what definition?</p>
  <p>--Step back and look for data to put the statistics in context. Don't think
    about it in isolation; what are the trends, what can it be compared to,
    what can give you a sense of scale.</p>
  <p>--Get the backstory: where was the data from and how was it collected? What
    was the sample size? How large was the effect? Was it statistically
    significant? Beware the replication crisis; don't rely on one study -
    what was a preponderance of the literature, covering multiple methods and
    results, suggest?</p>
  <p>--Ask who is missing, and how that may bias results. Was the study only
    conducted on WEIRD subjects (Western, Educated, and from Industrialized
    Rich Democracies)? Male vs female, young vs old? Was it a random,
    representative sample or was there sampling bias?</p>
  <p>--Don't confuse the right data with data that is easier to collect -
    introduces sample bias!</p>
  <p>--Beware using correlation for prediction. If you don't know what causes
    the correlation, you wont know what causes its' predictive power to
    breakdown. Eg google flu trends correlated flu with winter; it totally
    missed summer flu outbreak. Demand transparency in models IOT understand
    how they can break down and be exploited.</p>
  <p>--Computers and algorithms aren't racist, sexist, etc. But if they are
    trained on our own historical biases they can be. Ask which algorithms can
    we trust, and what can we trust them with?</p>
  <p>--Don't take statistical bedrock for granted. Statisticians can be
    pressured to change or omit the stats.</p>
  <p>--Never let zippy design distract you from the fact that the underlying
    numbers may be wrong.</p>
  <p>--Without well-defined standards for statistical record-keeping, nothing
    adds up. Numbers can easily confuse us when unmoored from a clear
    definition.</p>
  <p>--Bottom line: be curious and question everything!</p>

  <h1>Play Nice But Win by Michael Dell</h1>
  <p>date completed: 2022-01-15</p>
  <p>--Benefits of build to order:
  <br> - no need to keep WIP or finished goods inventory means low inventory
    carrying costs
  <br> - low COGS because pay latest costs for inventory and (in PC industry)
    inventory costs are dropping rapidly
  <br> == minimize cash conversion cycle </p>
  <p>--Quick growth: incentivize and partner with other companies. Eg. Dell
      offered Honeywell $30 per computer produced, in exchange for Honeywell
      providing next day onsite service. Won't be successful unless partner
      capabilities match.</p>
  <p>--"Anyone who says you can start a company and have work-life balance is
      lying."</p>
  <p>--"Success is not a straight line up. It's fail, learn, try again, then
      (you hope) succeed. How successful you are is really a function of how well
      you deal with failure - and how much you learn from it.... Persistence is
      an all-important quality on the road to success. (And success presents its
      own challenges, avoiding complacency being the first and biggest. Which is
      why, along with kaizen, PBNS - pleased but never satisfied - has been part
      of our culture since the beginning)."</p>

  <h1>Managing for Results by Peter Drucker</h1>
  <p>date completed: 2022-01-27</p>
  <p>--Reinforce success (and opportunity), not failure. Don't assign your most
     skilled people to the hard problems, assign them to the ones that provide
    greatest opportunity for future. Eg don't assign best salesmen to the
    hardest to win deals, assign them to the deals that will drive
    tomorrow's success.</p>
  <p>--"Concentration is the key to business results". Focus focus focus! If
    you have a B2B and B2C business, pick one and focus, don't serve mediocre
    products to both. Concentrate on the 20% that will produce 80% of
    results.</p>
  <p>Don't cut cost by implementing a "fair" across the board 5-10% cost. This
    may hamstring otherwise successful efforts. Focus on where the
    preponderance of costs are.</p>
  <p>Three tasks of the executive: 1) making effective the present business
    2) finding business potential 3) making the future of the business.</p>
  <p>"Focusing resources on results is the best and most effective cost
    control...no matter how cheap or efficient an effort, it is waste, rather
    than cost, if it is devoid of results."</p>
  <p>"The one truly effective way to cut costs is to cut out an activity
    altogether. To try to cut back costs is rarely effective. There is little
    point to trying to do cheaply what should not be done at all."</p>
  <p>Before deciding where to cut costs, build a holistic view of the entire
    business - the cost stream - from supplier to customer. Then identify where
    significant costs are (highest percentage of dollar paid by customer) and
    where effective cost reduction can take place. Is it in materials?
    Distribution/warehousing costs? Rather than cutting cost to increase
    margins, can you manage cash flow better (faster)? Develop a view of the
    costs as a system before taking action.</p>
  <p>"Not-doing" or waste can be a high cost as well - eg planes or trucks
    coming back empty on return leg instead of full. To fix, processes and
    business models may need to be re-designed.</p>
  <p>The natural state of a business is entropy: gradual decline in performance
    and increase in waste/costs. Only a purposeful program can counteract it.</p>
  <p>Build on strength. Look for opportunities rather than problems, stress
    attainable results rather than dangers to be avoided. Control your destiny,
    don't let it control you.</p>
  <p>"First-class people must always be allocated to major opportunities, to the
     areas of greatest possible return for each unit of effort." Accept risk by
     assigning less resources to weaker opportunities.</p>
  <p>Be ruthless with prioritization: "never assign high-grade resources to
    anything but major opportunities...[do] not create resources for secondary
    opportunities...leave secondary opportunities to fend for themselves."</p>
  <p>Allocate resources by stack-ranking opportunities and resources, then use
    "forced-choice" method to allocate top resources to top opportunities.</p>
  <p>Beware industries with high break-even volume and price requirements. "The
    business that runs at a loss unless it runs at 98 percent capacity and at
    boom-levels of price is highly vulnerable."</p>
  <p>"Unless the few really first-rate resources are put full-time on the few
    outstanding opportunities, priorities have not really been set."</p>
